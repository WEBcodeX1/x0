24. Glossary
============

24.1. Application Developing Documentation
------------------------------------------

Application Development Documentation including system installation and configuration, chapters 1-19.

24.2. Bootstrap
---------------

A popular front-end framework used for building responsive and mobile-first web applications. The x0 system includes Bootstrap 5.3 stylesheets without JavaScript dependencies, providing a lightweight and extendable base.

24.3. Cross-Objects
-------------------

The "cross" in x0 signifies communication. x0-objects are capable of exchanging metadata internally or over the network using JSON.

24.4. CSS Grid System
---------------------

A layout system used in x0 for responsive designs. It ensures device-independent responsiveness by leveraging the Bootstrap Grid feature.

24.5. Docker
------------

A containerization platform used to package, deploy, and run x0 applications. Pre-configured Docker images are provided for quick setup.

24.6. Developer Documentation
-----------------------------

*x0-system* Development Documentation including *x0-object-modeling* how-to, chapters 20-26.

24.7. DIV2ObjectMapping
-----------------------

A core feature of the x0 system that maps a single JavaScript Object Instance to a rendered DOM DIV. This mapping enforces a 1:1 association for managing objects and their parent/child relationships in the DOM.

24.8. Fontawesome
-----------------

An icon library integrated into the x0 base system, offering high-quality icons for use in applications.

24.9. Kubernetes
----------------

An open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. x0 applications are deployable on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with native integration.

24.10. Multi-language Support
-----------------------------

The x0 system supports multiple languages (currently English and German), allowing real-time language switching without page reloads.

24.11. Object Orientation
-------------------------

x0 provides true object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities for JavaScript, enabling clean code and efficient DOM object modeling.

24.12. Object Combination
-------------------------

A feature allowing the chaining and reusability of existing objects to create new composite objects. This is a fundamental aspect of the x0 framework's object modeling.

24.13. PKCS 11 / PKCS 15
------------------------

Public Key Cryptography Standards supported by the x0 system for enhanced security. It includes compatibility for Private Key Infrastructure (PKI) management.

24.14. Real-Time SPA
--------------------

Single Page Applications (SPAs) built on the x0 framework operate in real time, offering a desktop-like user experience while being backend-independent.

24.15. Responsiveness
---------------------

The capability of a web application to adapt seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes. The x0 system achieves this through Bootstrap CSS and the CSS Grid System.

24.16. Sphinx Documentation
---------------------------

A documentation generator used to create the x0 system's developer guide and technical documentation.

24.17. Target Group
-------------------

The intended audience for the x0 framework includes developers seeking a robust, OOP-based framework for building modern SPAs.

24.18. True DOM OOP
-------------------

A methodology provided by x0 for object-oriented DOM modeling, enabling developers to manipulate and extend DOM elements programmatically.

24.19. Zero Bootstrap JavaScript
--------------------------------

The x0 system integrates Bootstrap stylesheets without relying on Bootstrap's JavaScript, ensuring a lightweight and flexible framework.

24.20. x0-system-object
-----------------------

Alias: *x0-object*.

A fundamental unit in the x0 framework. It represents an object within the x0 system that combines metadata, functionality, and inter-object communication capabilities. These objects are designed for seamless integration and efficient abstraction in Single Page Applications (SPAs).

24.21. x0-screen
----------------

An abstraction in the x0 system that represents a visual layout or view. It is used to manage and display interactive components within the Single Page Application (SPA). Screens in x0 are dynamically rendered and can communicate with x0-objects for seamless data sharing and updates.

24.22. x0-base-class
--------------------

A foundational class in the x0 framework that provides a standard structure for creating objects. It includes built-in methods for data abstraction, object chaining, and metadata handling, enabling developers to create reusable and extendable components efficiently.
