1. Preface / Abstract
=====================

The x0 (cross-objects) JavaScript Framework is a modern tool for building
powerful Web-Browser **Realtime-SPA (Single Page Applications)** easily.

Decoupled GUI-Logic from the backend into the browsers x0 JavaScript system
let Spaghetti-Code say goodbye, Model-View-Control and OSI-Layer-Model how it should be!

Providing combinable **OOP based templates** makes **Real-time Instanciable Objects**
possible. Chained Objects containing Base-Classes, Container-Data and Logic-Callbacks
easily can be copied in realtime without communicating with Backend-Services.

Example see: :ref:`enhancedobjects`

The system provides "*Standalone*", "*Docker*" and "*Kubernetes*" installers.

See: :ref:`installation`

1.1 Architecture Overview
-------------------------

1.2 CSS Themes / Bootstrap
--------------------------

By implementing OpenSource Frameworks **Bootstrap** and some Free Font Libraries
x0-System is easily themeable.

Also Delveloping Times will be reduced by selecting the following theme types:

* Use Commercial Themes
* Use Open Source Themes
* Design / Let develop Custom Themes by Experts

1.3 Simplicity / Highly Structured Data
---------------------------------------

The highly structured OOP based code and Object-definition makes x0 usable for
big projects containing large amounts of Object-Data / Screens.

Recursive **Object Data Serialization*** allows very simple data structure handling
of single and combined objects (e.g. Lists containing Complex Object Types).

Data is returned in structured / hierarichal JSON format, see: :ref:`dataserialization`.

All mentioned topics make the x0-System very Dev-Ops friendly.

1.4 Middleware / Web-Services
-----------------------------

External Systems-Integration (e.g. Business Logic) is done by a) defining **Direct Web-Services Calls**
from within the Browser / x0-Application or b) using the shipped **x0-High-Speed-WebServices-Gateway**.

The following components make it very easy to model and administer very big, high structured
Service-Oriented-Architectures (**SOA**) without **Performance-Compromises**.

Components:
***********

* High Performance Python-Application-Server / Web-Services Gateway / Middleware
* ESB (Enterprice Service BUS) / Python Class-Mapper / Automated API-Generator

1.5 Licensing
-------------

The Base System is licensed under the OpenSource AGPLv3 license.

Some components like the WSIWYG-Editor will be released under different licensing-models
(not yet defined).

1.7 Future Milestones
---------------------

The systems internal OOP based architecture allows extending it further with suitable
functionality. One of em is a **What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get Editor**.

WYSWYG Editor / Screen Designer
*******************************

The editor should provide:

* An Object Editor IDE like QT-Designer or MS Visual Studio for Visual Basic
* An Direct Object Editing by right clicking on the related Object (SPA Edit-Mode-Switch)
* Object Modeling / Edit Object Relations / Edit Screen Relations
* Minimal Direct Code Editing Functionality

The editor makes it even possible to decrease Time To Market / Developing Time by a factor
of **x**.

#TODO: calculate / measure factor value
