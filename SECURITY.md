# Security Policy

## Project Scope

This project is small and maintained by a limited number of contributors. While we strive to provide a secure codebase, the scope and resources for security management are limited.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

- **Please report it privately.**
- Email the maintainer(s) at [security@webcodex.de], or open a private GitHub security advisory if available.
- Do **not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities until they have been addressed.

## Maintainer Response

- Due to the limited size and resources of the project, response times may vary.
- We aim to review and address security reports within **14 days**.
- Critical vulnerabilities will take priority, and fixes will be released as soon as possible.

## Security Best Practices

- We encourage users to keep dependencies up to date.
- Please report any security concerns even if you are unsure.

## Contact

For any security-related concerns, contact: [security@webcodex.de]
